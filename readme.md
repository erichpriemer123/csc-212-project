CSC 212 review project 

summary
Our program is able to process any course that you have taken and output your grade averages based on the scores you have recieved.
Each course can be looked at as a collection of different catagories of assignments. These categories may include exams, homework, quizzes, inclass assignments, etc. Users can provide input to the program, in order to recieve specific information about their course grades. This output includes:
    -The grade you have recieved for a specific assignment
    -The overall grade of a specified category and all the indivual assignment grades that are in that category
    -All grades. Inlcuding category grades, the indivdual assignment grades within those categories, and your 
    final grade of the course 
    -The course grades and the final grade
    -Only the final grade 
 
We are able to calculate these based off a text file given by the user. This text file will include all of the categories and how much weight they hold towards the final grade as well as each indivudual assignment. What makes our program unqiue is the fact that you can use any course within the program, not just csc 212. It can take in any amount of categories and any amount of assignments and produce an accurate grade.
